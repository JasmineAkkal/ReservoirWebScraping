Reservoir Webscraping

In this project I have tried to scrape the realtime data from https://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/getAll?sens_num=15 since the data is available for public I am taking the data to get the real time water level and place the liguidGuage on the google maps to show the percentage of the the water based on the capacity of the reservoir. 
This show the web scraping and integrating that with Google Maps along with the use of liguidGuage
